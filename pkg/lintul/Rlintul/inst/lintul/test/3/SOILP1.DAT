* maximum effective rooting depth
RDMSO    =  150.  !  maximum rooting depth as determined by soil structure [cm]

* surface runoff fraction
RUNFR    =   0.0 ! average fraction of precipitation lost by runoff [-]

* correction factor of time course of soil evaporation (value between 1 and about 4)
CFEV    =   2.0

* percolation to deeper soil layers
KSUB    =   10.   ! maximal percolation rate from lower zone to deeper soil layers [cm day-1]
