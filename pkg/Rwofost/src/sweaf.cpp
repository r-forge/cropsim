The fraction of easily available soil water between field capacity and wilting point is a function of the
potential evapotranspiration rate (for a closed canopy) in cm/day, ET0, and the crop group number, CGNR (from
1 (=drought-sensitive) to 5 (=drought-resistent)). The function SWEAF describes this relationship given in tabular
form by Doorenbos and  Kassam (1979) and by Van Keulen and Wolf (1986; p.108, table 20).
