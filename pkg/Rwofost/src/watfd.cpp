In routine WATFD the simulation of the soil water balance is performed for FREELY DRAINING soils
in the water-limited production situation.  WATFD is derived from subroutine APPLE of WOFOST Version 4.1.

The purpose of the soil water balance calculations is to estimate the daily value of the soil moisture content. The soil moisture content
influences soil moisture uptake and crop transpiration. In the initial section soil physical data are read from file SOFILE,
and all rates and sum totals are set at zero. The dynamic calculations are carried out in two sections, one for the
calculation of rates of change per timestep (delt = 1 day) and one for the calculation of summation variables and state variables.
The water balance is driven by rainfall, possibly buffered as surface storage, and evapotranspiration.
The processes considered are infiltration, soil water retention, percolation (here conceived as downward water flow from
rooted zone to second layer), and the loss of water beyond the maximum root zone.

The textural profile of the soil is conceived as homogeneous. Initially the soil profile consists of two layers, the actually rooted
soil and the soil immediately below the rooted zone until the maximum rooting depth (soil and crop dependent). The extension of the root zone
from initial rooting depth to maximum rooting depth is described in subroutine ROOTD. Its effect on the soil moisture content is accounted
for in this subroutine WATFD. From the moment that the maximum rooting depth is reached the soil profile is described as a one layer system.
The dynamic output is written to file by subroutine PRIWFD.
